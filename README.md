# Architecture Center - Draft/Collaborative Content

Welcome to the Progress Chef Architecture collaboration space!

This is a starting point for contributing to any content / best practices or labs that once accepted will become part of Chef's Community Architecture Center.  The Architecture Center aims to be the authoritative source on best practices, patterns and use cases for all Progress Chef family of tools.

Looking for something specific? Check out our [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents).

To learn more about each of our project's structure and organization, please refer to [Governance](./GOVERNANCE.md).

## How We're Organized

Progress Chef (the company) produces many products such as Chef Infra, Chef InSpec, Chef Habitat, and Chef Automate.

## Content Lifecycle

It is important to know this space is for collaboration but not the final resting place for content. Content when accepted will be added to the community.chef.io's architecture center and tagged back to this repository. That means this repository will generally be "ahead" of any officially recognized content or patterns. 

## The Bar

Any content found on the architecture center will be considered endorsed by Chef.  This means the content needs to either target users or specifically call out the expected users skill/experience level. Regardless of skill level the content should be prescriptive, include both the positives and negatives for implementation/usage and include any alternative (if applicable).

## Skill Levels
1XX – (Entry Level) All users should be able to read and understand the content/pattern.
2XX – (Beginner) Should expand upon items in 1XX content, and begin to introduce more complex topics
3XX – (Intermediate) content, designed to help teams increase automation and scale
4XX – (Advanced) 
5XX – (Expert)
6XX – (Professional) Integration / Extension

## Contributions

We encourage all users to become reviewers/contributors to this project.
