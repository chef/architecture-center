# Content Structure & Guidelines

This document serves as a guide for contributors who wish to add new content, ensuring consistency, quality, and accessibility across all materials. Here are the elements required when structuing your submissions for maximum impact and clarity.

## Content Structure Overview

Every piece of content submitted to this repository should include the following components:

1. **Title**: Clearly and concisely reflects the content.
2. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the content, including its purpose and relevance.
3. **Audience**: Specifies who the content is intended for, including skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
4. **Prerequisites**: Any prior knowledge, tools, or setups required before engaging with the content.
5. **Content Type**: Identifies the nature of the content (e.g., tutorial, documentation, lab exercise).
6. **Body**:
   - **For Documentation**: Break down concepts, features, or instructions step-by-step.
   - **For Tutorials/Examples**: Provide detailed steps with explanations and code snippets or configurations as needed.
   - **For Labs/Training Material**: Include objectives, required tools, step-by-step instructions, and expected outcomes.
7. **Pros and Cons** (optional): Highlights the advantages and limitations of the tools or practices covered.
8. **Examples**: Real-world applications or scenarios where the content can be applied.
9. **External Links**: Additional resources for further learning (official documentation, related articles, etc.).
10. **Conclusion**: Summarizes key takeaways and next steps.
11. **References**: Cite all references and sources used in creating the content.

Each folder should contain subfolders organized by topic or technology, and further divided by audience skill level when applicable.

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Fork and Branch**: Fork the repository and create a new branch for your submission.
2. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for files and folders, avoiding spaces and special characters. Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words in file names.
3. **File Formats**: Submit documents in Markdown format (`.md`) for compatibility and accessibility. Other files (code, configs) should adhere to their standard conventions.
4. **Pull Request (PR)**: Submit a PR against the main branch with a clear description of your contribution, its purpose, and any other relevant details.
5. **Peer Review**: Your submission will be reviewed by community maintainers for relevance, accuracy, and clarity. Be open to feedback and revisions.

## Review and Approval Process

- Submissions are reviewed on a rolling basis.
- Feedback or requests for revisions will be provided through the PR comments.
- Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the repository.
