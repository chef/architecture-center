# Governance Rules for Chef Architecture Center Content

## Introduction
This document outlines the governance rules for the open source repository chef/architecture-center, aimed at fostering a collaborative environment where community members can share, discuss, and contribute to the best practices and patterns for using Chef Tools (Infra Client, Workstation, InSpec, Habitat, Courier, Node Management, ...). Our goal is to ensure a transparent, inclusive, and efficient process that enables the continuous improvement of the repository content, supporting both new and existing users.

### 1. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Archiecture Lead(s)**: Oversees the project's direction, approves changes to governance rules, accepts submissions as best practices/patterns, and has the final say in disputes or decisions.
- **Maintainers**: Responsible for reviewing and merging contributions, managing issues, and ensuring the quality and relevance of the repository content.
- **Contributors**: Anyone who submits pull requests, reports bugs, proposes improvements, or actively engages in discussions.

### 2. Contributing
Contributions Welcome: We encourage contributions from everyone, regardless of their level of experience. Contributions can include, but are not limited to, documentation, design proposals, code snippets, and bug reports.

Contribution Process:
- **Fork** the Repository: Start by forking the repository and making your changes in a new branch.
- **Follow** Best Practices: Ensure your contribution adheres to the established best practices and coding standards.
- **Pull** Request: Submit a pull request (PR) against the main branch. Describe your changes and any relevant context.
- **Review** Process: Maintainers will review your submission, provide feedback, and request changes if necessary. Be open to discussion and adjustments.
- **Integration** Once approved, maintainers will merge your contribution into the main branch.
- **Releasing**: Once content has been integrated, reviewed and endorced by the Archiecture Lead(s) the content will be published on the community.chef.io Archiecture Center.

### 3. Decision Making

- **Acceptance**: The decision to accept a proposal into a best practice or endorced pattern (or changes to said content) are done by the Archiectre Lead(s). 

- **Consensus-Based**: When content in a best practice or best practice or pattern is contested, a Consensus-Based approach will be used to; this concensus will primarily involve active contributors and maintainers. We strive for agreement but allow for healthy debate and discussion.

- **Voting**: If consensus cannot be reached, decisions may be made by voting, with each maintainer having one vote. The Archiecture Lead(s) have the authority to make final decisions if a deadlock occurs.
