# What is Courier?

<!--
Courier is a powerful Job Orchistration component of Chef Platform. 

Job orchestration is about creating and managing workflows that automate a sequence of tasks across multiple systems. This process is crucial for managing complex IT environments, where it's necessary to synchronize and streamline operations across different platforms and tools​​.

Job orchestration streamlines and optimizes frequently occurring workflows, or enables infrequent worklows to be exeuted on-demand. It plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of IT processes such as server provisioning, incident management, and incident response.

Courier provides the ability to rapidly integrate new tools and technologies, develop and iterate end-to-end processes, and standardize and maintain permissions, auditing, and business rules across various environments. Courier also offers a unified view for monitoring processes, infrastructure, and systems from a single location​​.
